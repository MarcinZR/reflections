When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Remote repository would be used when collaborating with others on a project or just 
  wanting to share the code with others. Remote repository is also great for keeping 
  an external backup of your work.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Pulling changes manually allows for better control of the remote repository. The 
	updates to it happen only when they are ready.
