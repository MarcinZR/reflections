When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Remote repository would be used when collaborating with others on a project or just 
  wanting to share the code with others. Remote repository is also great for keeping 
  an external backup of your work.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Pulling changes manually allows for better control of the remote repository. The 
  updates to it happen only when they are ready.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

  Fork - when you 'fork' a project on GitHub you are actually cloning it and registering 
  under your own username, independently of the original project. You can then clone 
  and push changes to your personal fork without requiring access to the original 
  repository. Github will also keep track of the relationship between the two repos, 
  so that pulls and pushes can be visualized. Forking only happens within the context
  of the GitHub.
  Clone - is taking an existing repository and making a duplicate of it. This can be done
  on local repository or GitHub to local.
  Branch - happens on a single repository and they (branches) remain part of the original 
  repository.
