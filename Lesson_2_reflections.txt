What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a git repository, a hidden folder ".git" is created in
	the working directory. In this folder git records all the changes that were
	made to your work. We need to initialize a repository because it does not
	exist.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is where the index of changes gets built up so that they can 
	be committed together. It provides for the better control of the version
	control.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	When the file is added to the repository, it sits in the staging area as
	the changes are being made to it. When I have made the logical change to
	the file, I can then choose to make the commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	Having branches would be helpful if I tried new features in the program 
	or when trying something dramatically different with the code. Having
	branches would keep my original files intact.
